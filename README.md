# TASK-2 HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-BLUETOOTH

# What is it?
Home Automation with Bluetooth lets you control home devices (like lights, fans, etc.) using your smartphone through Bluetooth.
You don’t need to touch switches — just tap buttons on your phone!

# How does it work?
-You press a button in a mobile app (like Bluetooth Terminal or a custom app).

-The command is sent over Bluetooth to an Arduino (or any microcontroller).

-The Arduino receives the command and turns ON or OFF the connected devices (like a light or fan).
